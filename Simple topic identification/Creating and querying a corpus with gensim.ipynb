To get started, we have imported a few additional messy articles from Wikipedia, which were preprocessed by lowercasing all words, tokenizing them, and removing stop words and punctuation. These were then stored in a list of document tokens called articles. You'll need to do some light preprocessing and then generate the gensim dictionary and corpus.\n",
